Driven by agricultural surplus, trade, and iron technology, these urban centers became hubs of economic, cultural, and political activities. They laid the groundwork for subsequent empires, setting the stage for Indiaâ€™s long-standing urban and economic traditions. These developments not only shaped the socio-political landscape of ancient India but also fostered a legacy of cultural and economic interconnectivity that continues to influence the subcontinent. </p>';
